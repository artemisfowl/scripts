There are 2 configurations in this directory for alacritty.

The TOML file is for the new vanilla version of Alacritty, it contains all the colorscheme related configurations for Catppuccin.
The YAML file contains the same, but for ligature support.

For ligature support, one should be cloning this repository: "https://github.com/zenixls2/alacritty/tree/new_ligature"

A fork of the ligature support should also be present with oldgod.
