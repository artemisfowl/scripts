#### Usage Instructions for setting GOPATH specific to the project.

Please place either *activate-deactivate* pair of files in the directory and source them. Sourcing the activate file would activate the GOPATH and deactivate would reset that accordingly.

If one wishes to reduce that hurdle, once can also use the single file *act* which does the same function.
In order for setting the GOPATH to that specific project, just source the file. Deactivate command is available in order to deactivate the GOPATH set.
